# Flash Cards

This project is a mobile app that allows users to study using collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. The app is developed using React Native and Redux. This is a project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the React Nanodegree Program.

## App Functionality

- Allows users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
- Allows users to add a card to a specific deck.
- The front of the card displays the question.
- The back of the card displays the answer.
- Users can quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
- Users receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

## Project Setup

- install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
- start the development server with `yarn start`
