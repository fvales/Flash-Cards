# Flash Cards
This project is a mobile app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. The app is developed using React Native. This is a project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the React Nanodegree Program.

## App Functionality

- Allows users to add a card to a specific deck.
- The front of the card displays the question.

- Users receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
